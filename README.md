## Hi Welcome to my GitHub Account ðŸ‘‹

My name is William Kyungho Kim.

I am a junior studying Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo. This is where I post some of the projects I have been working on! I am interested in materials engineering and computing/AI and the endless possibilities for innovative solutions when combining the two. In between I have also invested my time into  learning about blockchain technology, macroeconomics and many other topics that I like to develop and showcase here.  

The projects in my github ranges from trading bots and genomic sequencing reader to signal processing. It covers the wide range of interests of mine.  Lastly, I love to learn about new algorithms, to bring about a better solution. 

This sentiment goes towards showing how I take on my projects but, also how I view my journey through school, career and general life and hoping to make constant improvements through foundational methods.  

Books I am currently reading ðŸ“š 
- Music by the Numbers 
- Freakonomics 
- Thinking, Fast and Slow 
- intelligent investor 
- Walden
